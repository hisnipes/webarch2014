I have done more front-end than back-end work with web architecture. I've 
mainly written in HTML and CSS, but I can hack together pieces of 
Javascript and PHP. I'm hoping to become much better at that.

My two usual browsers are Google Chrome (#1) and Firefox (#2). I really 
like Google Chrome because of the Chrome Extensions that I can add, and 
the browser's direct integration with my Google account. I know the latter 
point can be debatable because of potential issues with tracking user 
history, but it is convenient to have my sessions remembered with 
different devices. I also really like the Inspect Element/Developer Tools 
feature for Chrome as it makes it easy to experiment directly with the 
code without touching the actual files. For Firefox, there was a cool 
3D/tilt feature that allowed you to have a good look at the different 
elements layered on the page. I found that useful sometimes in trying to 
figure out z-indexes. In terms of memory management, Firefox also seems to 
handle a greater number of tabs better for me and crashes less often.
