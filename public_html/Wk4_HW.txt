Question 2
- The browser sends a GET request for the URL to the DNS server. (Link Layer)
- The DNS server looks up the IP address for the URL. (Network Layer)
- The browser will send a GET request to this IP address. (Transport Layer)
- The server will respond to the request with a response code. In this case, the response code was 302, or permanently redirected. The browser then sends a GET request for the redirect location, http://en.wikipedia.org, and receives a 200 response code (OK). It then loads the HTML for http://en.wikipedia.org. (Application Layer)
